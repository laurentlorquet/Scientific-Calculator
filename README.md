# Scientific-Calculator
Modular Scientific Calculator - that emphasizes modularity/extensibility, focuses on mathematical concepts, algorithms and numerics, and has an interactive interface.

## Extended description 
For my personal programming project, I developed an extensive scientific calculator application in C++ to showcase my skills in mathematical computing, object-oriented programming, algorithms, and user interface design. The calculator provides a wide range of advanced mathematical functions including complex number arithmetic, trigonometric calculations, exponentials/logs, matrix operations, combinatorics, and statistics.

The core of the calculator is implemented through modular, object-oriented code design principles to enable easy extensibility. Mathematical concepts are modeled using classes and key data structures like arrays and matrices. The user interface allows interactive calculation while validating inputs.

Significant effort went into researching and implementing performant mathematical algorithms like Taylor Series approximation for trigonometric functions, matrix decomposition for determinants, and factorial/permutation formulas. The calculator demonstrates mastery over core programming concepts like functions, loops, modularity, and problem solving.

Through this comprehensive project spanning numerical analysis, physics concepts, graphics programming, and complex engineering, I honed my skills in mathematical computing, C++, modular OOP design, algorithms, data structures, debugging, and application development. Architecting and building an extensible calculator from the ground up was an invaluable learning experience.
